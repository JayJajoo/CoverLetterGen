## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd extension_CV/backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret
   USER_AGENT=your_user_agent_string
   ```

5. Generate State Files:
   - You need to generate two state files in the backend directory for web scraping to work:
     - `linkedin_state.json`: Generated by logging into LinkedIn once
     - `nuworks_state.json`: Generated by logging into NUworks once
   - These files store authentication cookies and are required for scraping job descriptions
   - To generate these files:
     ```python
     # Run these functions from your Python environment
     from web_automation import login_linkedin, login_nuworks
     
     # For LinkedIn (you'll need to login physcially with your credentials using the popup window.)
     login_linkedin()
     login_nuworks()
     ```
   - The state files will be automatically generated in the backend directory


5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
